>> ARCHER: Oh, come on, how long are you guys gonna stay mad at me?
>> CYRIL: What, for getting us all arrested for smuggling cocaine into Colombia?
>> RAY: Probably the rest of our damn lives.
>> CYRIL: Well, shouldn't be very long, since we're headed to La Culebra, the most dangerous prison in South America. (chuckles)
>> ARCHER: Well, Cyril, when we get there and I join the toughest gang, don't hold your breath for a bid.
>> RAY: A bid?
>> CYRIL: They're prison gangs, not frats!
>> ARCHER: And don't call a fraternity a frat!
>> COP: ¡Callate! (Archer grunts, groans) (cops laughing)
>> ARCHER: No, I'm fine. Don't worry about me.
>> COP: And don't worry about La Culebra, gringos. You are not going there.
>> CYRIL: Oh, well, that's good. Is that good? It doesn't sound very good. Why does that sound really, really, really bad? >> ARCHER (sighs): Because they're gonna kill us.
>> CYRIL: What?! (cops laughing)
>> COP: Unle  you got maybe $100,000 U.S. on you.
>> ARCHER: Well, not on me, on me, but... (cops guffawing)
>> CYRIL: Hey, but when we're digging out own graves, they're gonna get cocky, and then we whang 'em with our shovels, right?
>> ARCHER: Cyril, this isn't an episode of B.J. and the Bear.
>> RAY: That was?
>> ARCHER: It's the jungle-- nobody digs graves; they just kneel you down by a ditch and put a bullet in your...
>> CYRIL: Cow!
>> ARCHER: Why would they shoot your... cow! (yelling, grunting, gasping) (birds chirping)
>> ARCHER: God... (crashing) (birds chirping)
>> ARCHER: ...damn. (Archer groaning, chuckling)
>> ARCHER: Well, now I'm almost afraid to say any-- (Archer groans) Eat a dick, jungle.
>> CYRIL: Easy, easy. Careful!
>> ARCHER: Cyril, for the love of Christ, man!
>> CYRIL: Sorry.
>> ARCHER: You have to shut up.
>> CYRIL: I am. Starting now. Starting... now.
>> ARCHER: Cyril...
>> CYRIL: Sorry. (gasps) (animal growls in distance) What was that?
>> ARCHER: Probably a jaguar excited about being magnificent and crepuscular. But I need you to focus on me, because if, by some miracle, I get the keys... (Cyril gasps) ...and then, by some other even bigger miracle, get us out of these cuffs... (Cyril sneezes) I am gonna beat the shit out of you, Cyril!
>> RAY: I'm gonna beat the shit of both of y'all.
>> CYRIL: Oh, my God, Ray!
>> ARCHER: You're alive?!
>> RAY: What, did y'all think I was dead?
>> CYRIL: Well, I just a umed.
>> ARCHER: Yeah, I totally did.
>> RAY: And you didn't even take a moment?!
>> ARCHER: I mean...
>> RAY: Oh, screw you guys!
>> ARCHER: W-Wait. What is in your mouth? >> GILLETTE (muffled): Nothing.
>> ARCHER: It's the keys!
>> CYRIL: He's eating the keys?
>> ARCHER: Ray, don't you eat those keys!
>> RAY: I'm not eating the goddamn keys.
>> CYRIL: Waagh!
>> RAY: Ow!
>> CYRIL: What are you doing down there?
>> RAY: What do you think I'm doing? (chain rattles)
>> CYRIL: Oh. (chuckles) sorry.
>> ARCHER: Do me! Do me, do me, do me, do me, do me! Ray, do me!
>> RAY: Ow! Ow! Ow!
>> ARCHER: Sorry. Do me, please.
>> RAY: First, promise you won't be mad at me.
>> ARCHER: I... Wait. Why would I be mad at you?
>> RAY: Because you're an a hole!
>> MALORY: I beg your pardon?!
>> LANA: Since Cyril's not here, I'm helping Cherlene redline her record contract, and I think we should move on. They're not gonna let you kill a guy.
>> CHERLENE: What about a dwarf?
>> MALORY: What about Sterling?!
>> CHERLENE: Wait, he's a dwarf now?
>> MALORY: He's mi ing! With God knows how much of our dwindling cocaine, and no one's doing anything to find him!
>> LANA: If he calls here, my plan, in its entirety, is to ask him where he is.
>> PAM: It has a simple elegance.
>> MALORY: Well, have you tried calling him? (auto-dial beeping)
>> MALLORY: What? (techno music playing)
>> PAM: Yaaaayyyyy!
>> CHERLENE: Wooooooooo!
>> FEMALE VOICE: The mailbox of...
>> ARCHER: ...Ar-Ar-Archer...
>> FEMALE VOICE: ...is full. Leave it.
>> MALLORY: All right! Turn it off! Turn it off! (voicemail me age repeating)
>> LANA: I can't! It's...
>> ARCHER: Ar-Ar-Archer. Archer.
>> KRIEGER: Rrgh! Rrgh! Rrgh!
>> ARCHER: (voice slows): Archer... Archer...
>> PAM & CHERLENE: Aw.
>> KRIEGER: Okay, so he forwards his phone here. That's easy. Then he taps the phone line into the intercom. They're both low-voltage. No big deal, but that's patched into the actual house wiring, obviously one-ten AC, which means he must have wired a transformer in the circuit somewhere, but he's got all these fake wires in here that don't connect to any... (Malory sobs)
>> MALORY: Is this all just a game to you people?! My God, I'm broke, my husband kicked me out of my own home, we're running out of cocaine, and on top of all that, my son is mi ing!
>> LANA: Um, okay, if Archer calls, I'll...
>> MALORY: No, please don't disturb me. I think I'm getting a migraine. (whistle blows)
>> CHERLENE: Outlaw country! Wooooooooooooooo!
>> MALORY: I honestly don't know how much more I can take! (Cherlene chuckles)
>> LANA: Wow. I think she seriously might be, like, nearing the end of her rope.
>> PAM: Hey, speaking of rope...
>> LANA: You want cocaine?
>> PAM: Yay!
>> ARCHER: Goddamn it! >> RAY: How is this my fault?
>> ARCHER: Because why do you always get paralyzed?!
>> RAY: Because why do you always crash every goddamn vehicle I get in?!
>> ARCHER: I didn't crash it! That crooked idiot, drunk murdering cop did!
>> CYRIL: Uh, yeah, speaking of, these guys don't look too good. (cop coughs very weakly)
>> ARCHER: Well, they're gonna look even worse when they're jaguar poop!
>> CYRIL: What? We can't just leave them here.
>> ARCHER: As opposed to what, Cyril?! You and I sling them over our shoulders and climb 200 feet straight up a cliff without a goddamn rope?!
>> CYRIL: I...
>> RAY: Wait. Where am I in that scenario?!
>> ARCHER: I gue  getting pooped out of a jaguar!
>> CYRIL: Well, we definitely can't leave Ray!
>> ARCHER: We have to! Ray, I'm sorry.
>> RAY: No, you're not!
>> ARCHER: I am, actually, which, whatever, but... (gun cocks)
>> CYRIL: We are not leaving Ray!
>> ARCHER: What do you even think you're doing?
>> CYRIL: I am taking command! (Archer and Cyril laugh)
>> CYRIL: Hey, I'm serious!
>> ARCHER: Oh, my God. Okay. Oh, that's really funny. Thanks, Cyril. I-I think we needed that.
>> RAY: We did. We really did.
>> ARCHER: Oh, man. Now give me the goddamn weapon.
>> ARCHER: You nut! (Cyril laughs)
>> CYRIL: Thought you were gonna hit me with it.
>> ARCHER: I was. Okay, so how do we get Ray and his usele  legs out of here?
>> RAY: Well, now, I actually have some thoughts on that. >> ARCHER (sighing): Goddamn it.
>> RAY: I think it's a pretty good plan, y'all.
>> ARCHER: No, it isn't! We might as well slather ourselves with whatever it is crocodiles eat, and swim down!
>> CYRIL: What do crocodiles eat?
>> ARCHER: Everything! They eat everything! And fear is their bacon bits.
>> CHERLENE: I don't understand what you're saying.
>> LANA: Damn it! Look, I think Malory is genuinely going through a really hard time right now, so I think we should do something nice for her.
>> CHERLENE: I don't understand what you're say...
>> LANA: Goddamn it!
>> PAM: I'm with you, Lana. It freaked me out seeing her cry like that. It was like seeing my dad cry.
>> LANA: Crying because...?
>> PAM: (splutters) Name it. He's a gigantic pu y. Oh, my God, when my mom died? Hey, and speaking of pu ies...
>> LANA: A Long Island Iced Tea? I'm not even supposed to drink regular iced tea.
>> PAM: Yeah, this is a Long Island.
>> CHERLENE: Yeah, stupid! Your words.
>> LANA: Shut up! And, okay, so what would cheer Malory up? What does she like?
>> PAM: Archer and money and liquor.
>> LANA: Besides that.
>> CHERLENE: Some different liquor.
>> PAM: You know what always cheers me up...
>> LANA: We're not giving her cocaine.
>> PAM: I was gonna say cock.
>> CHERLENE: Yeah, stup... Ow!
>> LANA: You done?
>> CHERLENE: I am. Thank you. >> LANA: A . And Pam, that's not a bad idea.
>> PAM: Hmm. I don't know if I'd be comfortable with that. I mean, even for me, it's...
>> LANA: Let me stop you before you say what it is you think I'm talking about.
>> PAM: Getting shitty drunk on two different kinds of liquor, dre ing up like Mr. Archer, and banging the old lady with a strap... Ow!
>> LANA: That's not what I had in mind.
>> PAM: Okay, good, 'cause the the dre ing up like Mr. Archer part makes it kind of weird.
>> LANA: I...
>> PAM: I'd have to be super drunk, like so drunk I bet I wouldn't even enjoy...! Ow! (Pam clears her throat) Okay, so what's your plan?
>> CYRIL: Well, eventually, we have to come to a village or whatever, and maybe we can barter with them for a ride, or...
>> ARCHER: Barter with what, Cyril?
>> CYRIL: I don't know. Maybe the gun, or... >> ARCHER (laughing): Yes! Great idea, yeah, Cyril. Let's give an M-16 to a bunch of wild Indians!
>> CYRIL: Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!
>> RAY: Goddamn, Huckleberry Finn!
>> ARCHER: What?! I don't think it's racist to a ume that a previously uncontacted tribe of indigenous peoples might react unpredictably, perhaps even wildly, to a bunch of white guys who walk up and hand 'em a goddamn M-16!
>> CYRIL: Oh, okay. I didn't know in your scenario the indigenous people were uncontacted.
>> RAY: Totally different scenario.
>> CYRIL: In which, no, you obviously wouldn't just want to hand them an M-16.
>> RAY: 'Cause they'd be, like, "What?!" Or whatever their word for that is.
>> MALORY: What?
>> LANA: A spa day!
>> MALORY: What? No. I can't go out like this.
>> LANA: No, no, no! That's the best part. It's here!
>> MALORY: Then it's not a spa day. It's just a bath! I want to go back to sleep!
>> LANA: Well, after this, you'll be so relaxed.
>> MALORY: I took three Valium! If I get any more relaxed, I will literally die.
>> LANA: Okay, well, that's also good... because you may not actually find this to be all that relaxing.
>> MALORY: What the...? Why are they dre ed like that? >> LANA (sighing): That was the only way they'd do it.
>> CHERLENE: Strip!
>> PAM: Yay!
>> CYRIL: Wait. What?
>> ARCHER: Crocodylus acutus! And maybe even... Are we in the Orinoco drainage basin?
>> CYRIL: How should I know?
>> ARCHER: Okay, so maybe  Crocodylus intermedius is in play! Not to mention four kinds of caiman, including the Black Caiman, which can grow up to 22 feet!
>> RAY: Is that why you're up on those goddamn cans?
>> ARCHER: Yeah, if a big bull croc slithers up on the raft, I'm gonna pour a ring of gas around me and set it on fire.
>> CYRIL: Why...?
>> ARCHER: Cyril, they can't chomp through fire. Although, I have no reason to think that.
>> CYRIL: Why are you so scared of crocodiles?
>> ARCHER: Gee, I don't know, Cyril. Maybe deep down, I'm afraid of any apex predator that lived through the K-T extinction.
>> CYRIL: The...?
>> ARCHER: Physically unchanged for 100 million years, because it's the perfect killing machine-- a half-ton of cold-blooded fury, with a bite force of 20,000 Newtons, and stomach acid so strong, it can di olve bones and hooves. And now we're surrounded, those snake-eyes are watching from the shadows, waiting for the night.
>> RAY: * Waiting For the night! *
>> ARCHER: Damn it, Ray!
>> RAY: * Ooh-hoo!
>> ARCHER: Keep your voice down! >> RAY: Why?! Crocodiles don't have ears!
>> ARCHER: They absolutely have ears, shit head!
>> RAY: Well, so do I, and you just talked yourself out of a hat! (all yelling)
>> CYRIL: Jeezy Pete's!
>> ARCHER: Way to go, Ray. Now he's got a taste for... (yelling)
>> RAY: Oh, my God!
>> CYRIL: Shoot it! Shoot it! Shoot it!
>> ARCHER: Uh, I can't!
>> RAY: Sweet Jesus God, then at least shoot out my eyes so I don't have to see! (yelling) Oh, my God!
>> CYRIL: What is happening? (yelling) Oh, God!
>> RAY: Oh, boy. (groaning and crying) No. (Archer groans) (Gillette and Cyril crying) (growling)
>> ARCHER: Huh. (Cyril and Gillette whimpering) I thought that was gonna be way more... epic-fireball-y. (Gillette whimpers)
>> CYRIL: Wuh-wuh, wuh-wuh, wuh-wuh...
>> ARCHER: Come on, Cyril. Pick one. Either have a stroke, or spit it out.
>> CYRIL: W-w-were you g-g-gonna say, "A taste for human flesh?"
>> ARCHER: No, I was gonna say, "Hat," but now it's not funny. Well, not as funny.
>> RAY: It's all your fault. It's all your fault.
>> ARCHER: Which part, Ray?! The part where I flipped our jeep down a cliff about 90 goddamn times, because I got drunk to cope with the fact I was about to murder us in the jungle?!
>> RAY: Well, it-it... it's your fault we're in this stupid jungle in the first place!
>> ARCHER: Well, if we're gonna go back to the beginning of time, Mother's the one who got us arrested for treason, and then bought a ton of goddamn cocaine!
>> CYRIL: I thought you b-bought it.
>> LANA: Wait. What?
>> MALORY: Up! Up! Hands off the goods, mister!
>> PAM: Aw.
>> MALORY: I said that's ridiculous. Where would I get 2,000 pounds of cocaine?
>> LANA: But if you didn't... Okay, so, where would Archer get that much coke?
>> MALORY: Well, who knows with him? Maybe wherever he got that new kind of VD none of the doctors had ever seen before.
>> LANA: Wha?! When was that?!
>> PAM: Yeah, when was that?
>> CHERLENE: Seriously, was...
>> MALORY: Trust me, if you had it, you'd know.
>> CHERLENE & PAM: Phew!
>> LANA: Ugh. I loathe knowing that I had sex with the same person as you two.
>> PAM: What? You had sex with me!
>> LANA: No, I... (gasps) Oh, my God, that's right.
>> MALORY: Ha!
>> PAM: What are you laughing at?
>> MALORY: Oh, my God, that's right.
>> ARCHER: So if you dicks want to blame somebody for our current predicament, blame...
>> RAY: You! I blame you! Archer! I blame you!  J'accuse! (flames whoosh, all yelling)
>> ARCHER: What was that, Ray?! (whistling) (laughs): Sorry. I genuinely couldn't hear you. (Cyril and Gillette crying)
>> ARCHER: Jesus, what is wrong with you two?
>> CYRIL: What's wrong?! What's wrong is we're about to be on fire!
>> RAY: Do something!
>> ARCHER: Uh, no?
>> RAY: Archer!
>> ARCHER: Not until you apologize.
>> RAY: For what?!
>> CYRIL: Ray, goddamn it, just apologize!
>> RAY: I... Jesus Christ, I'm sorry!
>> ARCHER: There, was that so hard? Okay! (Gillette coughing, sputtering)
>> CYRIL: What the hell are you... (coughing)
>> ARCHER: Crocodile repellent! >> CYRIL (coughing): What?!
>> ARCHER: We got to swim for it-- on three.
>> CYRIL: No, no, n... (grunts) Archer!
>> ARCHER: Sorry, three! Kick, Cyril, kick! (Cyril coughing) (Gillette retching, coughing) It's okay, stupid, I forgive you.
>> RAY: F...
>> ARCHER: Forgive, yes. Cannonball! Woooooo!! (Cyril retching) (Gillette moaning) >> ARCHER (chuckling): Oh...
>> CYRIL: Oh, God, I think I swallowed a leech.
>> ARCHER: Well, the gas ought to kill that.
>> RAY: (coughs) You a hole, you could've killed us! (Cyril clears throat) Well?!
>> CYRIL: Well, you did set the raft on fire.
>> RAY: Oh, my God, you always take his side!
>> CYRIL: I never, ever, ever take his side.
>> ARCHER: Blah, blah, blah, some joke about you two having vaginas. Come on, let's go.
>> CYRIL: Go where?
>> ARCHER: Well, long-term, I was thinking home. Short-term, I... Here, hold this. (grunts)
>> RAY: Go herd.
>> ARCHER: Short-term, somewhere that's not the crocodile version of a drive-through. (crocodile snarls)
>> CYRIL: Sounds good! Here we go!
>> ARCHER: Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
>> CYRIL: I got it. (grunting)
>> ARCHER: Cyril. >> CYRIL: What if I need a gun?
>> ARCHER: Um... here.
>> CYRIL: Oh, come on.
>> ARCHER: The only limit is your imagination. Pyoo! Pyoo! (Cyril sighs)
>> PAM: Aw, look, she's almost not terrifying.
>> LANA: (sighs) Thanks, you guys. I think the spa day took her mind off Archer being mi ing, even if it almost got weird.
>> CHERLENE: She made it weird.
>> LANA: No, you did. Nobody wants an enema.
>> CHERLENE: Some people...
>> LANA: Not with yogurt.
>> PAM: So... you think those guys are okay?
>> LANA: I don't know. I mean, if it were anybody else, I'd say no, but this is Archer we're talking about so... probably not.
>> CYRIL: Oh, for... Can you not give it a rest?
>> RAY: Not until he admits he's been half-a ing this entire cocaine debacle from the get-go.
>> ARCHER: That's only because I thought it was gonna be way easier.
>> RAY: You think everything's gonna be easy!
>> ARCHER: It almost always is!
>> RAY: Aha! See? That's what I resent.
>> ARCHER: What do you resent, Ray, my muscly shoulders poking into your tum-tum?
>> RAY: I resent how you never take anything seriously because you just a ume everything's gonna work out for you.
>> ARCHER: It almost always does! (Cyril sighs) Case in point.
>> CYRIL: What the...
>> RAY: Goddamn it. >> CYRIL (quietly): Hey, do you think those guys are Doctors Without Borders?
>> ARCHER: Yes, Cyril, I do. I bet those a ault rifles shoot polio vaccine. They're narcos, dummy. And that plane's probably loaded with coke. Okay, here's the plan...
>> CYRIL: What? Are you crazy?
>> RAY: You're out of your mind.
>> ARCHER: We have to get out of the country, so we can either walk out-- which, no, no, we can't-- or we can fly out in an airplane full of cocaine.
>> CYRIL: Ray is paralyzed. Who's gonna fly it?
>> ARCHER: Don't... That... Why would you worry about that before you need to?
>> CYRIL: What?
>> ARCHER: Why clog your brain with a bunch of hypothetical maybe-what-if bullshit?
>> CYRIL: Because...
>> ARCHER: Shut up. This is what we're doing. So, Cyril, lock and load that stick. (indistinct chatter) (Gillette stifles a sneeze) >> ARCHER (quietly): Manos  arriba. >> GILLETTE (whispering): Nice.
>> ARCHER: You want to...
>> RAY: Oh, right. (cocks gun)
>> BOSS NARCO: Bueno pues,  cuando está cargado...
>> RAY: Manos... Um... Wait, what was it?
>> ARCHER: Arriba! Goddamn it.  ¡Manos arriba! (weapons cocking)
>> BOSS NARCO: (chuckles) I don't think so, gringo.
>> ARCHER: Drop your weapons! I'm serious. I will shoot this guy right in the...
>> BOSS NARCO: (laughs) What the hell is that?
>> ARCHER: Pyoo! Pyoo! (narcos laughing)
>> CYRIL: Suppre ing fiiiiiire! (narcos shouting)
>> ARCHER: Okay, okay! (moans) Goddamn it, Cyril!
>> CYRIL: Woooooo!! (chuckles) Oh, geez, oh, geez, oh, geez! Sorry.
>> ARCHER: That's why I wanted you to be stick.
>> RAY: Uh-uh!
>> ARCHER: Yeah, come on. It's been a long day.
>> BOSS NARCO: Do you have any idea who we are?
>> ARCHER: Mmm... nope. Do you know who we are?
>> BOSS NARCO: No. (Archer burps)
>> ARCHER: Then blow me. Cyril, make sure it's good and tight. (Archer chuckles) Why are we not still doing phrasing?
>> CYRIL: Why are we still not worrying about who's gonna fly the damn plane?!
>> ARCHER: Oh, right.  ¡Oye, pendejos!  ¿Quién es el piloto? (narcos snicker) (narco speaks Spanish)
>> CYRIL: Oh, you are kidding.
>> ARCHER: Okay, Ray, ballpark, how long will it take you to teach me how to fly a plane?
>> RAY: What... How long?
>> CYRIL: I flew the space shuttle.
>> ARCHER: Cyril, hush. Big guys. Ray, how long...
>> RAY: How long will it take you, Archer, to admit you dick around every time we're in danger just to screw with everybody because of your complete... no, your utter contempt for your own mortality?
>> ARCHER: I mean... Yeah, duh.
>> RAY: That's all I wanted. (grunts)
>> CYRIL: (gasps) What? You could walk this whole time?! (Archer laughs)
>> ARCHER: No, Cyril, of course I'm not mad. I think what Ray did was awesome.
>> CYRIL: Okay, well, then you are an idiot.
>> ARCHER: Your words.
>> CYRIL: Which, I gue , so am I, since I just realized we can't land anywhere with all this cocaine onboard. Oh, my God, you guys, where are we gonna land?!
>> RAY: Jesus Christ, woman, calm down. We got five hours of fuel. We'll worry about that when we have to.
>> ARCHER: Gue  I'm rubbing off on you, Ray. Goddamn it!
>> BOTH: What?!
>> ARCHER: Why are we not doing "phrasing"?
